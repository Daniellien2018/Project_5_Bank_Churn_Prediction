# Project_5_Bank_Churn_Prediction
UT Austin AIML - Introduction to Neural Networks

## Description
Banks need to have a good understanding of which customers will leave and which will stay in order to be successful. The project is to build a neural network based classifier that will detemrine whether or not a client will leave in the next 6 months based on data like age, credit card score, and salary.
